You can arrive late at night and leave early in the morning, this will not be a problem. I will just ask you to provide your flight/train details after the booking is completed so I can make arrangements and make sure I will be able to welcome you. for very early check-ins or very late check-outs i will always try to make that possible, but if the place is booked by other guests it depends on their schedules.
